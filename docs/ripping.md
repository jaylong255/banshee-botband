# Ripping
This is how you rip computer sounds on a Mac using the Blackhole plugin. I will also likely explain how to use Quicktime to convert files from video to audio-only.

This is a process that is easy to forget but should be less than 60 seconds apart from waiting on the target media to finish playing.

### Process Log
This is a log of raw steps taken to remember how to do it.
- Open Quicktime
- Open media file source (Safari/Youtube in this case)
- Open Settings app
- Go to Sounds
- From the Output tab, select Blackhole Output as the output device
- From the Input tab, select Quicktime Input as the input device.

### Quick Reference
This is a refined list of concise numbered steps, assuming all I will need is a quick reminder after the initial deep dive of writing this document.

### Comprehensive Instructions
In order to retain this knowledge long-term and in order to be able to effectively troubleshoot the process in the future when the required software is updated or needs to be replaced, I need to gain a deeper understanding of what all is going on and why.

This is also a useful bit for anyone else following in my footsteps. For this purpose, I intend to break each step down into thorough and careful instructions with explanations. 

Hopefully, I will have time for this because it really is important.
